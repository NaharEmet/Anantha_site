This document defines **what is owned, by whom, and under what constraints** within the GAUSS ecosystem.

It is designed to:
- protect long-term assets from operational risk
- prevent capture by any single entity
- allow capital participation without control
- enable replication without centralization

It does **not** define governance processes, returns, or board mechanics.

## System Structure (At a Glance)

GAUSS is composed of **legally independent entities with non-overlapping roles**:
- **3 Holding Companies (HoldCos)** — own assets
- **3 Operating Companies (OpCos)** — run systems
- **1 Singapore Entity** — capital coordination & IP ownership

No entity has unilateral authority over land, infrastructure, IP, economy, or social systems.

---

## Core Design Principles

1. **Separation of Ownership & Operation**
    Assets are owned by HoldCos and leased to OpCos. Operators own nothing core.
    
2. **Asset Permanence**
    Land, infrastructure, and IP cannot be pledged, sold, or encumbered by operators.
    
3. **Operator Replaceability**
    OpCos can fail or be replaced without asset liquidation or system collapse.
    
4. **Jurisdictional Risk Containment**
    Capital and IP are held in Singapore to isolate political, regulatory, and execution risk.
    
5. **Non-Capture**
    No entity may simultaneously control assets, operations, IP, and governance logic.

## Holding Companies (Asset Owners)

### HoldCo 1 — Land & Core Real Assets
Owns land and permanent physical structures.
Leases assets to OpCos under fixed terms.
Low velocity, long-horizon, non-experimental.

### HoldCo 2 — Infrastructure & Automation
Owns energy, water, waste, and core automation systems.
Leases capacity to OpCos.
Capital-intensive, yield-oriented, technically conservative.

### HoldCo 3 — IP & Systems (Singapore)
Owns GAUSS, RC, and FABRIC software and replication frameworks.
Licenses IP to OpCos and future cities.
Owns no land or infrastructure.

---
## Operating Companies (System Runners)

### OpCo 1 — City Operations
Runs utilities, housing services, logistics, and daily operations.
Leases land and infrastructure; licenses IP.
### OpCo 2 — Economic Systems Operator
Operates Regenerative Currency (RC), payroll, and settlement interfaces.
Owns no monetary sovereignty or financial assets.
RC is non-extractive and non-speculative.

### OpCo 3 — Social Systems Operator

Operates FABRIC: mediation, repair, and social coherence processes.

No enforcement power, no assets, no monetization.

Human-in-the-loop and non-coercive.

---

## Singapore Investment & IP Layer

### Singapore Investment & Management Co

- Aggregates capital
- Holds equity in HoldCos and OpCos
- Coordinates shareholding and board mandates

Does **not** control day-to-day operations, civic authority, RC, or FABRIC.

### Singapore IP HoldCo

- Owns all core system IP
- Licenses IP on non-exclusive, non-transferable terms

This layer interfaces with global capital while shielding core systems from capture.

---

## Safeguards & Alignment

System-level actions require **cross-entity consent**.

Enforced through:
1. legal independence
2. non-overlapping ownership
3. contractual constraints
4. full transparency via immutable ledgers
5. AI-based coherence review

Deviation is detectable, contestable, and reversible — without central authority.

---

## Failure Isolation

- OpCo failure does not affect asset ownership
- RC suspension does not affect land or infrastructure
- FABRIC suspension does not halt city operations
- Replication failure does not affect the original city

Failures are **local, contained, and survivable**.

---

---

## Explicitly Prevented

- Investor ownership of civic authority
- Monetization of governance
- Speculative extraction of RC
- Consolidation of power across layers
- Single-entity system capture

---

### Summary

GAUSS is a **structurally separated, failure-resilient, non-capturable system** where land, infrastructure, economy, social systems, and capital remain interoperable but never co-owned.

It is built for long-term stewardship, not control.
