**Pricing Future Repair at the Moment of Action**

---

## What You See First

RC circulates through a **city-issued NFC bearer**, ideally a **physical bead**.

- Offline-first, apps or smartphones as secondary
- No identity or transaction history on the device

The bead is not fintech.

It is **public economic infrastructure**—as boring and universal as cash once was.

---

## What RC Is

RC is a **city-issued, INR-denominated derivative**.

It does not replace INR, compete with banks, or change prices.

It adds a **second accounting layer** that prices **future repair and maintenance costs** at the time of transaction.

The **city is the counterparty and balance sheet**.

---

## The Core Insight

Every transaction does one of two things:

- It **creates future repair costs**, or
- It **reduces future repair costs**

Markets price the transaction.

RC prices the **future burden on the city**.

---

## How It Works

Each sector is assigned a **Regenerative Coefficient (RCf)**—a coarse, actuarial measure of expected future repair impact.

- **Negative RCf** → activity creates future repair
    
    → RC flows **from the transaction to the city**
    
- **Positive RCf** → activity avoids future repair
    
    → RC flows **from the city to the producer**
    

RC is issued or absorbed as a function of expected repair load.

All values are denominated **1:1 with INR** for clarity and compliance.

RC does not price goods.

It prices **future maintenance**.

---

## The Key Incentive

**All fiat-only transactions inside the city incur a mandatory INR surcharge set at the maximum negative RCf.**

- Collected in INR
- Allocated directly to city repair budgets
- Not adjustable or rebated

Using RC is optional.

**Avoiding the surcharge is the incentive.**

---

## Wages

- Salaries negotiated in INR terms
- A portion paid in RC
- wages also have an RCf multiplier

Labor that maintains long-term capacity is quietly rewarded.

---

## Taxes & Convertibility (India)

- All pricing valued 1:1 in INR
- GST calculated and paid in INR as usual

A **strict tax-only conversion window** exists:

- RC → INR at 1:1
- Only up to verified statutory obligations

RC is **converted only for tax obligations**.

---

## Risk Controls

- Hard issuance limits
- Lossy, rate-limited conversion (0.75 : 1)
- negative interest rate disincentivizes hording
- Independent governance

RC cannot create fiat insolvency.

It only reveals costs that already exist.

---

## Why This Matters

RC:

- Prices long-term risk **without bans or regulation**
- Makes repair visible **before failure**
- Aligns private incentives with public maintenance
- Scales city-by-city without national reform

---

## Closing

**RC is not a moral system. It is not a currency experiment. It is a maintenance system.**

It does not tell people what to do.

It changes what the city rewards.
