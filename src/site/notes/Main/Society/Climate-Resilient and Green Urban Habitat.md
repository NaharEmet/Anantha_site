## Climate-Resilient and Green Urban Habitat

Anantha is designed with climate resilience as a foundational principle, integrating nature-based solutions, distributed energy and water systems, flood-resilient landscapes, and heat-mitigating urban forms. Adaptive governance, supported by real-time data, allows the city to evolve continuously in response to environmental and social feedback, rather than resisting change.

The urban form prioritises pedestrians, fostering compact neighbourhoods with shaded streets, extensive cycling networks, and vibrant green corridors. Mixed-use development ensures that daily needs are met within walking distance, promoting a healthy and active lifestyle. Green infrastructure is not merely aesthetic but performs critical functions: cooling the urban environment, managing stormwater effectively, enhancing biodiversity, and significantly improving public health.

A core tenet of Anantha's development is its role as a **Steward for Regenerative Forest**. The city actively prioritises degraded land for the creation of regenerative forests. This approach ensures a symbiotic relationship between urban development and the surrounding environment, where the habitat itself becomes an integral part of the forest's stewardship and ensures a balanced coexistence between development and nature.
