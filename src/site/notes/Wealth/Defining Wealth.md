# Defining Wealth  
## A Multi-Dimensional Framework

In Anantha, wealth is not measured by GDP, land value, or consumption alone.  
It is understood as the **long-term condition of people, communities, and ecosystems**.

Prosperity is not something extracted from land and labour, but something **cultivated through design, governance, and care**.

Urban success is therefore evaluated across multiple interdependent dimensions.

---

## 1. Health & Well-Being

Physical and mental health are primary indicators of prosperity.  
Clean air and water, nutritious food, access to nature, active mobility, and low-stress living environments define true urban wealth.

Health is not treated as an outcome of economic growth—it is the foundation of it.

---

## 2. Care, Equity & Social Resilience

A wealthy city is one where care for people, communities, and ecosystems is visible, valued, and rewarded.

Social equity, inclusion, safety, and mutual support are not externalities.  
They are core economic outcomes.

---

## 3. Food Sovereignty & Security

Wealth includes the ability of a city to nourish itself.

Local, resilient food systems, nutritional diversity, and independence from fragile global supply chains ensure stability in the face of climate and market shocks.

---

## 4. Creativity, Knowledge & Innovation

A prosperous society cultivates intelligence across art, science, technology, craft, and social systems.

Learning, experimentation, and cultural production are forms of capital that compound across generations.

---

## 5. Ecological Regeneration

True wealth is regenerative.

The city must increase biodiversity, restore degraded land, circulate resources, and operate within planetary limits—leaving ecosystems healthier than before.

> **Wealth is the long-term flourishing of people and planet—not the short-term accumulation of capital.**
