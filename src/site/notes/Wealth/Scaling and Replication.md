GAUSS does not scale through expansion or consolidation.

It scales through **structural advantage, replication, and choice**.

---

## 1. Adjacent Land Integration

GAUSS expands first by offering **integration** to adjacent landholders.

- Integrate GAUSS systems and build within guidelines → full access for residents
- Decline integration → remain outside the system with a clear physical and institutional boundary

No coercion is applied.

This creates a **land valuation arbitrage**:

Integrated land gains higher utility and access.

Non-integrated land remains functional but less valuable.

Cooperation becomes economically rational.

## 2. Replication, Not Growth

Once proven, GAUSS is copied — not enlarged.

- New cities are built as **independent instances**
- Each city has its own assets, operators, and governance
- No city governs another

Scale occurs by **copying complete systems**, not by accumulating power.

---

## 3. Networked Cities

Independent GAUSS cities form a **non-hierarchical network** to enable:

- Resident mobility
- Credential and participation portability
- Limited inter-city coordination

The network provides access, not authority.

---

## Summary

GAUSS scales by making cooperation more profitable than exploitation, and by allowing cities to be replicated without being owned.
