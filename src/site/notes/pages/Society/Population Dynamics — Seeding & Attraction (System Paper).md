**Why People Come — and Why That Matters**

---

## Core Claim

GAUSS does not rely on recruitment, ideology, or belief alignment to attract participants.

People move to places that offer:

- economic sufficiency
- freedom to explore
- access to interesting people
- social energy, play, and enjoyment

GAUSS is designed to provide these conditions **structurally**.

Population formation is driven by **pull**, not persuasion.

---

## Economic Sufficiency as Baseline

GAUSS ensures that residents can meet the material requirements of a good life without continuous economic stress.

This includes:

- structurally low cost of living
- easy access to essentials
- reduced dependence on precarious employment

Economic sufficiency is not a reward for contribution.

This removes survival pressure as the dominant driver of behavior and increases discretionary allocation of time and attention.

---

## Exploration Without Catastrophic Downside

GAUSS compresses personal and professional risk.

Residents can:

- change direction
- attempt new work
- disengage and re-engage
- fail without permanent exclusion or ruin

Exploration does not require approval, grants, or status.

This disproportionately attracts individuals who are inclined to experiment, build, and initiate rather than optimize defensively.

---

## Social Density and Informal Coordination

GAUSS is designed to maximize interaction density through:

- walkability
- embedded third spaces
- shared infrastructure along daily movement paths

These function as **coordination infrastructure**, increasing:

- trust formation
- informal collaboration
- speed of team and project formation

Transaction costs decline without formal intervention.

---

## Cultural Energy as System Health

Celebration, nightlife, and informal social life are treated as functional components of system stability.

They serve as:

- trust accelerators
- pressure release mechanisms
- signals of social vitality

A system that cannot sustain enjoyment cannot sustain long-term participation.

---

## Early Seeding as Risk Management

Early populations disproportionately influence:

- social norms
- conflict responses
- experimentation rates
- long-term system trajectory

GAUSS manages early risk through:

- progressive engagement
- time-bound participation
- contribution before permanence
- low-friction exit without stigma

This is not curation for virtue or ideology.

It is **failure-mode containment while systems stabilize**.

---

## Long-Run Equilibrium

As systems mature:

- selection becomes self sufficient
- social cohesion selects
- diversity increases
- structure replaces curation

GAUSS is designed so that, over time, **the city attracts participants through lived advantage alone**.

If ongoing systemic population curation is required, the system has failed.

---

## In Short

People come to GAUSS because it is an economically viable, socially dense, and enjoyable place to live.

That attraction is not incidental.

It is a **core input to the city’s value-generation engine**.
