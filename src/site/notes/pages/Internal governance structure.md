## Core Premise

GAUSS is designed with **zero expectation of individual intelligence, morality, or restraint**.

Governance therefore lives in **structure, transparency, and constraint**, assisted by AI — not in people.

All actions by corporate entities are recorded in a **public, immutable ledger**.

A good democracy is treated as a **system output of informed participation**, not a human assumption.

---

## Contextualization & Proposal

### _(AI Enabled Governance)_

Every participant is paired with an **AI agent** that:

- provides context and precedents
- discusses options with the individual
- explains consequences
- flags inconsistencies
- proposes actions and repairs

Humans **approve or reject** proposals; they do **not design governance manually**.

No decision proceeds without AI-generated context.

---

## Social Judgment & Repair

### _(Social Systems OpCo — FABRIC)_

**Function**: Determine what occurred, what norms apply, and what repair is appropriate.

- Runs conflict resolution, mediation, and repair
- Issues **non-coercive binding decisions**
- Produces legible social outcomes (what happened, what resolves it)
- Logs decisions publicly
- **Cannot enforce, budget, or control assets**

FABRIC has no punitive authority and no execution power. Its output is social determination only.

---

## Procedural Execution & External Interface

### _(City Operations OpCo)_

**Function**: Execute approved decisions and act as the system’s sole external interface.

- Executes FABRIC decisions procedurally
- Runs city services and internal task forces
- Serves as the **only authorized interface** to external bodies:
    - governments
    - regulators
    - vendors
    - institutions
- Cannot modify system rules
- Cannot hide or privately negotiate agreements

City OpCo implements outcomes; it does not reinterpret them.

---

## Economic Constraint & Budget Discipline

### _(Financial Systems OpCo — RC)_

**Function**: Apply mechanical economic constraints that limit systemic drift.

- Executes economic rules mechanically
- Controls budgets, payroll, and procurement
- Enforces the **minimum expenditure requirement**

This role contains no discretion. Constraint replaces judgment.

---

## Physical Capacity & Access Application

### _(Infrastructure OpCo)_

**Function**: Apply physical-world limits without civic authority.

- Operates energy, water, waste, and automation systems
- Applies access, capacity, and scheduling constraints
- No governance role
- No enforcement authority
- No policy-making power

Infrastructure responds to system state; it does not decide outcomes.

---

## Physical Safety

### _(Security — Subcontracted)_

**Function**: Maintain immediate physical safety only.

- No policing authority
- No governance role
- No investigative power
- No decision-making power

If force is required to preserve order, the system has already failed.

---

## System Enforcement Model

### _(Structural, Not Coercive)_

> FABRIC decides.
> 
> City OpCo executes.
> 
> Finance constrains.
> 
> Infrastructure applies.
> 
> The ledger exposes.
> 
> AI detects.

There is **no coercive enforcement layer**.

Visibility, constraint, and procedural execution replace force.

---

## External Relations

### _(Single Interface Rule — City Operations OpCo)_

**Function**: Ensure all external engagement remains legible and contestable.

- Only City OpCo may engage externally
- All engagements:
    - are logged publicly
    - are reviewed by FABRIC (social constraints)
    - are checked by Finance OpCo (economic exposure)
    - cannot override system logic (IP constraint)

If an external body demands secrecy, coercion, or rule changes:

- the demand is logged
- the agreement is paused
- the operator is replaced if necessary

The system is never bent to preserve an operator.

---

## Temporary Exception Handling

### _(Task Forces)_

**Function**: Address bounded, novel, or time-limited situations.

- Created by any company
- Fixed scope, fixed budget, fixed expiry
- No renewals without fresh approval
- No asset ownership
- No rule-making authority

All exceptional power expires by default.

---

## Non-Negotiable Safeguards

### _(System-Wide Constraints)_

- No entity may govern and enforce
- No entity may own assets and set rules
- No decision may be hidden
- No power may be permanent
- Operators are always replaceable

---

## Final Principle

> Governance in GAUSS is enforced by structure, not authority.
> 
> Visibility replaces force.
> 
> Repair replaces punishment.
